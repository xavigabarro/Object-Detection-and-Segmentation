# Object Detection and Segmentation

This project involves implementing object detection and segmentation on two different datasets. In the first part of the project, we fine-tune a pre-trained RetinaNet model to perform object detection on a subset of the Udacity self-driving car dataset. The task involves drawing bounding boxes around objects and assigning labels to them.

In the second part of the project, we train a UNet model to perform semantic segmentation of people contained in the pictures of the PennFundanPed dataset. The goal of semantic segmentation is to label each pixel in the image with the class of the object it belongs to.
